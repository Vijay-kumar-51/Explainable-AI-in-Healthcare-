# Explainable-AI-in-Healthcare
A Deep Learning project with Explainable AI in brain tumor Classification using MRI scans
The project is still in progress and here the brief idea about the project
Developing a deep learning–based system to classify brain tumors from MRI images using pre-trained CNN models (ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet). Implementing Grad-CAM to visualize tumor regions and improve model interpretability. Designing basic explainability metrics to compare model performance and support reliable decision-making. So, finally the project focuses on improving transparency and trust in AI-based medical diagnosis.
